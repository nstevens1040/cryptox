[Cryptox](https://nstevens1040.github.io/cryptox) simply allows you to exchange one cryptocurrency for another using the [ChangeNOW](https://changenow.io?link_id=dc49f0fd273c14) API.  
Until I can get acquire a ChangeNOW private key, you'll need your own [ChangeNOW API key](https://changenow.io/affiliate) to use this.  
  
Fair warning, I do believe they collect their own fees in addition to mining fees, etc.  
  
Additionally, I believe I also make a small amount (0.3% to 0.4% of the exchanged amount) per exchange. Though, that only happens when my API key is used to create the transaction.
